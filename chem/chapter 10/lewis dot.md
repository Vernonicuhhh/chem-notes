# Lewis Dots

## Ionic Bonding

- electrons exchanged

### Octet Rule

- electrons lost or gained to fill highest lvl with 8 electrons

### Valence Electrons

- electrons found in highest (outer) energy levels
  - responsible for bonding

## Atomic Radius

- unlike ball atom does not have fixed radius
  - atomic radius = 1/2 distance between nuclei of joined atoms
    - changes depending what is around it 

### Ionic Radius

- cations get smaller
- anions get larger

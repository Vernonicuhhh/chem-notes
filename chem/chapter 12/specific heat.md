# specific heat

## definition

- amt of heat transferred during temperature change depends on:
  - nature of material changing temperature
  - mass of material
  - size of temperature change

- **the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of substance by 1 C or 1K**

$$ q = mCAT$$

cp = q/mAT

q = heat

cp = specific heat

AT = change in temperature celcius or kelvin

J/gK or J/gC

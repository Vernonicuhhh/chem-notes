# enthlapy

## Thermodynamics

- thermochemistry
  - **study of changes in heat energy that accompany chemical reactions + physical changes**

### Chemical potential energy

- energy stored in chemical bonds

### Temperature

- average amt of kinetic energy

- Celcius or Kelvin

### Heat

- total amt of kinetic energy

- joules kilo-joules

## Why reactions occur

- reactions generally occur in order to allow system to go from high to low energy state
- heat will always flow from cold to warm

## Exothermic reaction

- generally favorable

- more potential energy stored in reactants
  - products more stable

- negative energy change
  - write energy on product side

$$A --> B + Energy$$

## Endothermic Reactions

- not generally favorable
  - more potential energy stored in products
    - reactants are more stable

- positive energy change

- energy often gets written on reactant side

$$A + Energy--> B $$

## Enthlapy

- heat content of system

### Delta H of formation

- 0 = standard state
- F = formation

- enthlapy of formation
  - **change in heat that accompanies formation of one mole of compound from its individual elements at 25 degrees celcius**

- individual elements always = 0

- delta H = enthlapy change of reaction

$$ delta H = delta H products - delta H reactants$$

# Enthlapy of Fusion

## Calculating Heat

- delta H = enthlapy, units are usually kJ/mol
- q = heat
  - units are generally in kJ or J or calories 
    - 1 cal = 4.18 J

- amt of substance must match units in delta H

## Energy + state change of state

- temperature does not change when matter is changing phases

- heat of fusion
  - "enthlapy of fusion"
  - amount of energy it takes to melt one gram of a substance

- heat of vaporization
  - "enthlapy of vaporization"
  - amount of energy it takes to vaporize one gram of substance

delta h of fusion is melt

delta h of vaporization is 

go to knutson student support

number 1 is -54 and s is -94 but might have very close answers

carlift can lift cars with it
can do a lot of adjustment because of pads and bars on the bottom 

reservoir tank - filled with oil
stores oil and cannot operate without certain amount of oil

hydraulic pump -  integral pump and motor together
uses electric motor to drive it but pump does all of the work

transmission lines - comes off the pump at an angle and goes into the cylinder all the way to the top

hydraulic cylinders - connected to transimssion line and then raises the vehicle up

safety release with lock out mecanismhas dogs (raised tab on inside of housing (spring activated latch that snaps underneath in case pressure is lost (keeps the car from falling and killing gpeople)))
you cannot lower unless the dogs are disengaged


lifting capacity is 10 thousand lbs

lowering process disengage lock system and then pull the lever down

operation of hydraulic lift
as we start lifting oil level decreases because it is flowing through tranmission line to pressurize the cylinders

pickup at bottom pulls oil to bottom
keeps the machine from breaking so air does not enter the system

below oil level return - keeps air out of system
must be all hydraulic levels at all time

must have filter so seals are not eaten 

filter on bottom that keeps oil clean

piston pushes cylinder up (diff from what we usually se on linear actuator(this is a linear actuator))

hydraulic systems are not the cleanest all the time

very clean system for this one
      minimal oil on the cylinder

oil level comes back up when the machine is lowered

works of combo of pneumatic + hydraulic

but this is hydraulic electric bc system is driven by motor

motor is 2.2 horsepower

motor manufacturer s csn

as thing lowers, oil is displaced back into reservoir

can lift 8-10 ft and you need a lot of oil to lift that much

we didnt go too high for today's demo

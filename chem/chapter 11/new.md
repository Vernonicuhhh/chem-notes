# What should I call this

## Specific Heat

- amount of heat transferred during temperature change depends on:
  - nature of material changing temperature
  - mass of material
  - size of temperature change

- specific heat
  - amount of heat energy required to **raise the temperature**

- water is weird in that it takes much more energy to be able to heat up
  - high specific heat
  - table tells us amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of one gram
  - air changes temperature very quickly

$$ q = mCΔT$$

$$Cp = q/m(ΔT)$$

*Cp* - specific heat at constant pressure

*m* - mass

*ΔT* = change in temperature

*q* - heat

# water

polar molecule

## intramolecular forces 
attraction between atoms within moelcule

## intermolecular forces
- attraction between molecules

  -  Oxygen has negative force
  - hydrogen postive force

### Hydrogen bonding 
 acctraction of bonded hydrogen atom to unbonded electron pair on another molecule
        
    does not make up chemicals it is between two SEPERATE chemicals



# physical properties of water
 ## surface tension
 resistance of liquid to an increase in surface area

 ## cohesive forces
 forces holding liquid together to present minimum surface area

 *water is sticky*
 ## capilary action

 spontaneous rising of liquid in narrow tube due to two forces

 - cohesion
 - adhesion

### cohesion and adhesion  
  ***adhesion*** - water sticking to something else

  ***cohesion*** - water sticks to water
    
    allows water to bead up

cohesion and adhesion create high surface tension which allow somethings to walk on water    

## Great Solvent
the universal solvent

***hydrophillic*** - polarity is stronger than cohesive forces of water

    water will bond around polar substances

***hydrophobic*** - nonpolar that get pushed out by water's cohesive substances

## Ice density

  *solid less dense than liquid* 


## heat capacity

- water is good at retaining heat

  - **helps keep temperature constant**

### sweating explained
heat breaks hydrogen bonds as water evaporates and takes heat with them which cools you down

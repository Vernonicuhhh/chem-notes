# Colligative properties

## Colligative Property

- effect solute has on solvent

### effects

- lowers vapor pressure
- lowers freezing point
- raises boiling point

### General Rule

- more solute particles that are present per solvent, greater effect


## Ways to Separate Mixtures

### Crystallization

- dissolving ionic substances in water and then allowing them to recrystallize

### Chromatography

- allows solution to flow through stationary substance
  - **separate base on solubility**

### Other methods

- filtration
- centrifugation
- Distillation

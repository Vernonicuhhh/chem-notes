# Solution Formation

three processes speed up formation:

- heat
- agitation
- particle size

these make particles move faster

big chunks take forever to dissolve

## Miscibility

### Miscible
if 2 liquids mix and dissolve in each other

### immiscible
liquids repel and one goes up to top (never mix)

    ex oil and water

## Saturated vs unsaturated

### Solubility 
how well substance dissolves in certain amt of solvent at certain temperature to produce saturated solution

- Saturated - in the middle
- unsaturated - more solute can be dissolved
- super saturated - no more solute can dissolve

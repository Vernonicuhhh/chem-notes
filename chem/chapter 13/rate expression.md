# Rate Expression

## intro

- reaction mechanism: sequence that reaction goes through
  - most reactions involve multiple steps
  - each step involves collision
  - one step will be slower than others

- Rate expression - constant multiplied by reactants
  - order of reaction refers to exponents of concentrations
  - exponents can only be found experimentally

- rate = k[reactants]^order

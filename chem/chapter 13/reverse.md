# Reversal

## Equilibrium Constant

- Keq = ratio between the concentrations products formed at equilibrium to concentrations reactants (g and aq only)

$$ A (aq) + B(g) ---> <---- 2C(aq) + D (aq) $$

- Keq = 1 nothing favored
- Keq > 1 products favored
- Keq < 1 reactants favored

## Le Chatelier's Principle

- if stress is applied to system in dynamic equilibrium system will change to relieve stress:
  - temperature
  - concentration (affects gases, liquids + aqueous materials no solids)
  - pressure: affects gases

### Concentration + temperature

- what would happen if I add reactant: (shift right) makes more products
- what would happen if I remove product: (shift right) makes more products (more efficient because you dont have to spend anything unlike adding reactant)
- What would happen if I put reactant in freezer if Enthlapy was positive (endo): (shift left) make more reactant

### Pressure

- count number of moles
  - add or take away from the side with more moles

- Increase Pressure:
  - means: add pressure to reactants
    - (shift right)
    - make more product
